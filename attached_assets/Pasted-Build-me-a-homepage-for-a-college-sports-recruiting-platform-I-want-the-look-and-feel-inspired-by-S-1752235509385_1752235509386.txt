Build me a homepage for a college sports recruiting platform.
I want the look and feel inspired by SportsRecruits.com and NFHCARecruits.com, but unique to my brand.

Design Style & CSS:

Use a clean, modern, athletic look with plenty of white space.

Main brand colors: Deep blue, bright accent (orange or green), and neutral backgrounds.

Large, bold headlines in a sans-serif, collegiate-style font.

Subheadings and body text are clear and easy to read.

Use card layouts for features, benefits, and calls-to-action.

Hero section with a gradient or athletic background pattern, featuring a bold headline, CTA button, and a mobile app mockup or athlete photo.

Smooth, subtle hover effects on buttons and cards.

Shadow and depth effects for cards (soft box-shadows, not harsh).

Rounded corners (medium to large radius for cards and buttons).

Clean, sticky navigation bar with logo on the left and login/signup buttons on the right.

Responsive design—looks great on mobile and desktop.

Accent lines or shapes (waves, diagonals, or geometric patterns) to add visual interest.

Prominent CTAs ("Get Started", "Sign Up") in accent color.

Footer with dark background, columns of links, and muted colors for secondary info.

Sections to Include:

Hero section with headline, subheadline, CTA, and app/athlete image.

Audience selection cards: Student-Athletes, Coaches, Clubs/HS Staff.

Features/benefits in horizontal or grid card layout, each with icon/image and short text.

Social proof section: Stats, testimonials, or partner logos.

"How it works" (step-by-step or journey cards for each audience type).

Large "Get Started" CTA section above the footer.

Footer with multiple link columns.

Code Output:

Use modern, semantic HTML5.

CSS: Use either Tailwind CSS utility classes or hand-written CSS in a <style> block.

Prioritize accessibility (good contrast, readable fonts, large click targets).

Use placeholder images or SVGs for app mockups, athlete images, or icons.

Name the primary CSS classes so it’s easy to customize later.

Optional:

Add a mobile menu for smaller screens.

Subtle transition effects for section reveals or button clicks.

Summary:
Make it look and feel like a high-end, trustworthy, and energetic sports recruiting platform—fresh, easy to scan, conversion focused, and visually appealing for Gen Z athletes and coaches.
